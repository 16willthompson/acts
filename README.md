# A Tracking Software (ATS) Project

This library is based on the track reconstruction software developed by the 
[ATLAS Collaboration](http://cern.ch/atlas).

The main philosophy is to provide high-level track reconstruction modules that 
can be specified for detector technologies by simple extension.

* Event Data Model (EDM)
* Geometry 
* track reconstruction tools

The library is attempted to build against Gaudi and Gaudi-Athena, while
additional external dependencies are kept at a minimum.
